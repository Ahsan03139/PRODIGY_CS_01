# 🔐 PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project is a part of the **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

It demonstrates the implementation of a **Caesar Cipher**, a classical encryption method that shifts characters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet to encrypt or decrypt a message.
